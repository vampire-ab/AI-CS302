Problem Statements:

Read about the game of marble solitaire. The figure shows the initial board configuration. The goal is to reach the board configuration where only one marble is left at the centre. To solve marble solitaire, (1) Implement priority queue-based search considering path cost, (2) suggest two different heuristic functions with justification, (3) Implement best first search algorithm, (4) Implement A*, (5) Compare the results of various search algorithms.


Write a program to generate k-SAT problems randomly.  The program must accept values for k, m the number of clauses in the formula, and n the number of variables.  Each clause of length k must contain distinct variables or their negation.  Instances generated by this algorithm belong to fixed clause length models of SAT and are known as uniform random k-SAT problems.


Write programs to solve a set of uniform random 3-SAT problems for different combinations of m and n, and compare their performance.  Try the Hill-Climbing, Beam-Search with beam widths 3 and 4, Variable-Neighborhood-Descent with 3 neighborhood functions.  Use two different heuristic functions and compare them with respect to penetrance.
